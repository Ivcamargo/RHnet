- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables (primary: hsl(210, 100%, 25%), secondary: hsl(180, 60%, 70%), accent: hsl(120, 50%, 70%))
- **Build Tool**: Vite

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM
- **API Design**: RESTful API endpoints
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL session store (production)
- **File Structure**: Organized into routes, storage layer, and database configuration

### Authentication System
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Supports local email/password (argon2id hashing) and Replit OIDC (for migration)
- **Session Management**: Express sessions (memory store for development, persistent store for production)
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (superadmin/admin/employee)
- **Security Features**: Rate limiting, secure password hashing, session-based authentication

### Database Schema
- **Key Entities**: Users, Departments, Time Entries, Break Entries, Face Profiles, Sessions, User Shift Assignments
- **User Fields**: Includes passwordHash, mustChangePassword, passwordResetToken, passwordResetExpires
- **Shift Assignments**: userShiftAssignments table with userId, shiftId, startDate, endDate for flexible temporal assignments.

### Features
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Full offline support, installability, manifest configuration, service worker for intelligent caching, and PWA meta tags.
- **Geolocation**: Browser Geolocation API, Haversine formula for distance, department geofencing, real-time location status.
- **Time Tracking**: Clock in/out with location/facial verification, break management, automatic calculations. **Timezone**: All timestamps saved in UTC, displayed in Brazil timezone (America/Sao_Paulo). Function `getBrazilianTime()` returns UTC timestamp representing current Brazil time.
- **Shift Management**: Consolidated interface in "Gest√£o de Setores" with tabbed navigation, advanced interval support (breakStart/breakEnd), and comprehensive CRUD for shifts.
- **Rotation Management**: Dedicated `/admin/rotation-management` interface for CRUD operations on rotation templates (daily, weekly, monthly, custom cadence), segment configuration, and automatic schedule generation.
